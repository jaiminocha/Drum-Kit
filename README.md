# Drum-Kit
Learning Drums was never this easy. Now it is with this great webpage made using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 
Event Listeners are used to detect a key press or a click to make the respective sound of the instrument.
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. 
DOM concepts learnt and implemented in this Project.
